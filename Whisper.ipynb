It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

            " If you want to get a job as a programmer, you need to know big O. Imagine you have a shuffled deck of cards. If you want to pop one card off the stack, that's extremely fast, or O of 1 constant time. But if you then want to count the cards, you'll need to loop over the entire deck, resulting in O of N or linear time. But now let's imagine we need to sort the deck in perfect order. That's going to require a strategy or algorithm like bubble sort, where we loop over the deck repeatedly and swap out adjacent cards until the entire thing is perfectly sorted. In the worst case, we loop over at 52 times, giving us O of N squared or quadratic time. Alternatively, if you're stupid, you could throw the cards up in the air, and hope that they land perfectly sorted on the ground. That's called BogoSort, and gives you O of N factorial, the worst possible time complexity. But now, we want to find the eight of hearts in the sorted deck. Instead of looping through every card, you could do a binary search by splitting the deck in the middle. If the shown card is greater than 9, go left, otherwise go right. Continue that process to cut your work in half after every step. That thus giving you O of log N or log rhythmic time.\n"
