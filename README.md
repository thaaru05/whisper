Whisper Speech-to-Text Project
This project demonstrates the use of OpenAI's Whisper model to perform speech-to-text conversion. The notebook contains step-by-step implementation details for leveraging the capabilities of Whisper to transcribe audio files into text.

Features
Speech-to-Text Conversion: Transcribes spoken audio into text with high accuracy.
Pre-trained Model Usage: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model, reducing the need for extensive training.
Customizable Settings: Parameters for fine-tuning transcription output can be adjusted.
Python-Powered: Implemented in Python with a focus on simplicity and usability.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or above
Required Libraries:
torch (for model execution)
transformers (for accessing Whisper model)
numpy (for numerical operations)
librosa (for audio preprocessing)
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers numpy librosa
How to Use
Clone the Repository: Download or clone this project to your local machine.

Prepare Audio Files: Ensure that audio files are in supported formats like .wav or .mp3.

Run the Notebook: Open the Whisper.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Modify Parameters: Adjust the model settings, such as language and transcription preferences, in the notebook as needed.

Generate Transcriptions: Execute the cells to load the model, preprocess audio, and generate transcriptions.

Output
The notebook outputs transcriptions for the provided audio files. These can be further processed or saved for downstream tasks like subtitle generation or data analysis.
